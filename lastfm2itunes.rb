# This is a tiny utility script to update your iTunes Library's played counts to match your last.fm listening data
#  This is useful if you've had to rebuild your library for any reason.
#  The utility only updates tracks for which the last.fm play count is greater than the iTunes play count.
# Because of how cool the AppleScript hooks are, watch your iTunes libary as this script works!
